A list of eXtensibleStylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) processors
#######################################################################################

The converters automatically generate instances of LinkedMDR ontology. They transform XML outputs of existing tools and APIs into LinkedMDR RDF instances.

The conversions do not consist of simple transformations of XML descriptors into RDF instances.
They also involve a set of rules that infer LinkedMDR instances that do not correspond to any annotation generated by any of the existing tools or APIs.  

The available converters are:
- DC to LinkedMDR: an XSLT processor that transforms DC descriptors into LinkedMDR instances based on the semantics provided by LinkedMDR Core Layer and LinkedMDR Standardized Metadata Layer, more precisely the sub-layer dedicated to DC standard;
- TEI to LinkedMDR: an XSLT processor that transforms TEI descriptors into LinkedMDR instances based on the semantics provided by LinkedMDR Core Layer and LinkedMDR Standardized Metadata Layer, more precisely the sub-layer dedicated to TEI standard;
- MPEG-7 to LinkedMDR: an XSLT processor that transforms DC descriptors into LinkedMDR instances based on the semantics provided by LinkedMDR Core Layer and LinkedMDR Standardized Metadata Layer, more precisely the sub-layer dedicated to MPEG-7 standard;
- xLinks to LinkedMDR is an XSLT processor that transforms GATE* annotation sets describing inter and inter-document references into LinkedMDR instances based on the semantics provided by LinkedMDR Core Layer;
- Domain to LinkedMDR is an XSLT processor that transforms GATE* annotation sets describing domain-specific information into LinkedMDR instances based on the semantics provided by LinkedMDR Core Layer and LinkedMDR pluggable Domain-Specific Layer.
